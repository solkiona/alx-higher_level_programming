**Classes and Objects in Python**

Overview
In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to define your own data types and create instances of those types, enabling you to structure your code in a more organized and reusable manner.

**Classes**

A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class can have. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects of the same type.
