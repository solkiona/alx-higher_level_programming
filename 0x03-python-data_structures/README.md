Introduction
Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and programming. They allow us to organize and manipulate data efficiently, enabling us to solve complex problems effectively. This repository provides Python implementations of commonly used data structures, including:

Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Binary Tree
Heap
Hash Table
Graph
and more...
Each data structure is designed to serve specific purposes and comes with its own set of methods and operations for easy data manipulation.

#Available Data Structures
Array: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
Linked List: A linear collection of elements connected through nodes.
Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
Binary Tree: A hierarchical structure composed of nodes with at most two children.
Heap: A specialized tree-based structure for efficient extraction of the minimum or maximum element.
Hash Table: A data structure that maps keys to values for quick retrieval.
Graph: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
